### 👋 Hi, I’m @deibysarteaga
- 👀 I’m a FrontEnd web developer.
- I have knowledge of CSS, Javascript, React.js, Bootstrap, SASS among others.
- Using the aforementioned technologies I can create web designs, pages and applications. 😁
- I created a telegram channel to keep track of each of my projects. In summary, in the channel I have the name of the project, a small description, the link to the repository, and some images of the project. I think it's a good way to keep the projects ordered.
